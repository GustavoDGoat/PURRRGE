Change Log for License Key Fixes

Issue: License keys not working properly to unlock extension features

Analysis:
1. Current implementation uses simple array comparison for license validation
2. No proper error handling for malformed keys
3. Basic validation only checks format but not key integrity
4. Website blocking limits needed adjustment

Changes Made:
1. Added enhanced validateLicenseKey function with proper validation and error handling
2. Improved key format validation using regex pattern
3. Implemented proper tier-based validation (Basic vs Premium)
4. Added activation date tracking for license keys
5. Removed unnecessary console.log statements
6. Streamlined the license validation process
7. Added structured validation response with isValid, tier, and error information
8. Updated website blocking limits:
   - Basic license: 10 websites maximum
   - Premium license: 50 websites maximum

Results:
- License keys now properly differentiate between Basic and Premium tiers
- Basic keys limited to 10 website blocks
- Premium keys allow up to 50 website blocks
- Better error messages for invalid keys
- Improved tracking of license activation
- More robust validation system
